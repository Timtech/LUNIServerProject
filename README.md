# LUNIServerProject
A repository trying to bring back the defunct game, LEGO Universe.

This is a GitHub-Project for the developers of LUNI (Lego Universe Newly Imagined), a project to create a server in C++, using the RakNet libraries, that will be able to provide all aspects of the LEGO Universe game as it was when it was live. Don't download any files from here if you aren't a developer, because the versions here aren't tested and may include many bugs. If you are searching for a tested version of the LUNI-Server, visit [TimTech Software](http://bit.ly/-lu-).

If you would like to get involved, but don't have enough knowledge, please see the [kickstart in the wiki](https://github.com/jaller200/LUNIServerProject/wiki/Getting-Started-in-Development).

Please visit out development IRC channel at #luni-server-dev on Freenode! [![Visit the development IRC channel](https://kiwiirc.com/buttons/irc.freenode.net/luni-server-dev.png)](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?nick=luniuser|?&theme=mini#luni-server-dev)

Repository Owner: [jaller200 (Jon002)](https://github.com/jaller200)

##Requirements

* [Visual Studio 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) (community/express will work fine)
* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or similar WAMP stack (specifically a MySQL server and the ability to set it up with the LUNI software)
* LUNI Compatable LEGO Universe client for testing ([Nexus2 (Direct Download)](http://timtechsoftware.com/lu/nexus2.zip) client suggested)

##Usage

1. Gather and install all neccessary components listed in requirements
2. Clone this repository locally, or download the source directly
3. Import the .sql to your MySQL database. If using phpMyAdmin, start Apache and mysql and then open the admin page. Click the import button on the right, then browse to locate the sql file from the source and import it. Apache should not be needed afterwords (unless you need to use phpMyAdmin).
4. From here, as long as the MySQL database is running, you should be able to run the LUNI Server application through a built executable or using the debugger in Visual Studio, and connect into it using the Nexus2 Client.
